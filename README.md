## üßº Data Cleaning Process

All cleaning was done in Google Sheets. Key steps included:

1. Removed blank cells using the filter tool  
2. Removed duplicates with the Data Cleanup tool  
3. Split the Date/Time column and deleted the Time section  
4. Formatted the Date column properly  
5. Cleaned text in the Gender column using the `=PROPER()` function  
6. Used `VLOOKUP()` to bring in age and gender columns from the customers sheet  
7. Deleted rows with missing customer details  
8. Created age groups using a nested `IFS()` formula  
9. Replaced all formula columns with their pasted values  

Screenshots of the process are available in the `screenshots` folder.

## üí° Reflections & Lessons Learned

This project helped me practice essential skills in spreadsheet-based data analysis. Here's what I learned:

- How to clean messy data using filters, formulas like `=PROPER()`, and the data cleanup tool in Google Sheets
- How to use `VLOOKUP()` to merge datasets from different sheets
- How to use pivot tables to uncover insights and answer business questions
- The importance of structuring projects clearly and documenting my process
- How to use GitHub to organize and present a portfolio project

As a beginner, I feel more confident handling real-world datasets and presenting my work in a professional way. This project also taught me the value of screenshots and clear storytelling ‚Äî something I‚Äôll apply to future case studies!
