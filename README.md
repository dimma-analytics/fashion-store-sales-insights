## 🧼 Data Cleaning Process

All cleaning was done in Google Sheets. Key steps included:

1. Removed blank cells using the filter tool  
2. Removed duplicates with the Data Cleanup tool  
3. Split the Date/Time column and deleted the Time section  
4. Formatted the Date column properly  
5. Cleaned text in the Gender column using the `=PROPER()` function  
6. Used `VLOOKUP()` to bring in age and gender columns from the customers sheet  
7. Deleted rows with missing customer details  
8. Created age groups using a nested `IFS()` formula  
9. Replaced all formula columns with their pasted values  

Screenshots of the process are available in the `screenshots` folder.
